## GAE + AngularJS Template
This project is a template to get you started making a rich application with AngularJS and Google App Engine easily.

 - Uses a modified Angular-seed project
 - Includes an ANT Build Script
 - Bootstrap & Font Awesome
 - Some GAE python boilerplate for request handlers
 - Configured app.yaml file

 Would like to include in the future a custom built angular service for the Google App Engine Channel API.
